    <p>Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the 
        western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. 
        Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly 
        insignificant little blue green planet 
        whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still 
        think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
